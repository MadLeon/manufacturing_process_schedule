' mod_CreateHyperlinks.bas
' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Module Functionality:
'   - Provide functions to create hyperlinks based on drawing numbers selections (single/multiple)
'   - Provide API to add a hyperlink when creating a new job entry
' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Notes:
' 1. Directly query a drawing_number is more efficient and reliable than with a drawing_name
'    - drawing_name: the pdf file name, which may not always contain the drawing number
'    - drawing_number: the ID of a drawing
' 2. When drawing_number lookup fails, use drawing_name with customer folder matching
'    - drawing_name is more likely to contain the drawing number as part of the file name
'    - Matching customer folder increases accuracy in case of meaningless drawing numbers
'      e.g., "Sample" could exist for multiple customers. It will cause problems in future lookups
'            if we accept it this time and store it in the database.
' 3. Use customer_folder_map table to map customer names to folder aliases
'    - Some customer names in Delivery Schedule Sheet may not match folder names in file locations
'      e.g., folder_name: D.J.Indus vs customer_name: DJ Ind.
'            MDA                    vs M.D.A
'    - Use the map table to build a connection with them
' 4. Store the founded drawing_number for later use, which will be faster and more reliable
